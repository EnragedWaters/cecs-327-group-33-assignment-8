HOW THIS WORKS:

1. Server:
Upon execution, this will attempt to directly connect to MongoDB (which is then connected to Databiz)
Any issues connected will be immediately seen in the console, and reconnecting is advised.
From here, it will also allow the user to choose a port and IP of their choosing.

2. Client
Upon running the client script, it will request the IP and Port of the Server being ran above. Once a connection is established, the user has 4 options to choose from, such as finding average moisture, electricity consumption, or exiting the program. The commands are done numerically 1->4 to streamline the getting of information from MongoDB.

And that's it!
